## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshots/desktop-screenshot.png)
![](./screenshots/mobile-screenshot.png)

<!-- Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.** -->

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

<!-- **Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices** -->

### What I learned

Learned more about Flexbox and CSS Grid. Learned how to add overlay color over an image and how to use the `mix-blend-mode` attributes.

I tried using ```<picture></picture>``` tags to show images in different screen sizes but I was having a hard time setting the border-radius in correct corners for the mobile screen size. So, used the usual ```<img></img>``` tag instead with `display` attribute to hide or show the images.

Would appreaciate any feedback and would love to know a more efficient way of handling the images.

<!-- ```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
``` -->
```css
.image {
    position: relative;
}

.image::before {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background-color: var(--soft-violet); 
    mix-blend-mode: multiply;
    pointer-events: none;
    border-radius: 0 var(--border-radius) var(--border-radius) 0;
}
```
<!-- ```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->

### Continued development

Still not comfortable with media queries, so going to continue practicing on more responsive design projects.

### Useful resources

- [mix-blend-mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode) - This helped me to easily play with different overlay shades.
